 FightApp version 1.0 10/26/2014

 ruby version 2.1.2

I expect this App to reduce the amount of time wasted looking for good fight clip, by having only "a hand picked selection" of the best fight scenes, chosen by users that know what a Glorious Battle looks like!

FightApp is focused on having 'Only the Best' Martial arts and Anime, fight scenes.

Videos start out in a 'Amateur Pool of movie clips'.  Users vote on which fight clip is "Legendary".

When a fight clip gets 10 likes from Users, then that video moves on to 'Legendary Fight' status--front and center via,Landing - HomePage.  Else, if video gets 10 dislikes, video is deleted and replaced with a new clip.

only 5 of the most recently "promoted" videos may sit on the Homepage at a time.   A library will house all prior "Legendary Clips". for your viewing pleasure.

This App will weed out all the so-so fight clips leaving only the best of the best for your viewing pleasure.

Users may choose to simply browse and not sign up.
 **restrictions:** unnable to comment, vote on videos, or post videos.

Users that **sign** up may comment and vote on videos.  Even upload there own videos.  You claim to have good taste, through it in the pool, and lets see if you know whats good.

Phase I - Implement "User can vote", video's in "Amateur Pool" must be embedded, using youtube API.  Videos must also Delete/remove automatically |or| move to Landing Page --based  on vote count.

Phase II - Implement "User can upload", video's into "Amateur Pool" for a chance to be voted Legendary.  User must be able to paste entire URL, and algorithm needs to extract UNI.

Phase III - See Wireframing for more details.

require/dependencies - Bootstrap, sass/scss, other gems.
