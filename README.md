+Users that **sign** up may comment and vote on videos.  Even upload there own videos.
+All video clips, start out in a 'Amateur Pool of movie clips'.  Users vote on which fight clip is "Legendary".
+When a fight clip gets 10 likes from Users, then that video moves on to 'Legendary Fight' status--front and center via Landing Page.
Else, if video gets 10 dislikes, video is deleted and replaced with a new clip automatically.
+only 5 of the most recently "promoted" videos may sit on the Homepage at a time.   A library will house all prior "Legendary Clips", for Users viewing pleasure.

Phase I - Implement "User can vote", video's in "Amateur Pool" must be embedded, using youtube API.  Videos must also Delete/remove automatically |or| move to Landing Page --based  on vote count.

Phase II - Implement "User can upload", video's into "Amateur Pool" for a chance to be voted Legendary.  User must be able to paste entire URL, and algorithm needs to extract UNI.
